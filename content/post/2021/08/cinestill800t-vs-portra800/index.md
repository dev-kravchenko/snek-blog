## –°—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ
A lot of people asked me how I scan and develop photos shoot on Cinestill 800T. So I decided to make quick post showing settings with my comments.

As I mentioned in the comments, I only make minor changes to the photos. Since these are night time photos in low light I tend to overexpose a bit rather than follow values for metering in the shadows. (also I'm lazy to make adjustments for reciprocity failure)

This saves me from losing the details from the shadows. Highlights are safe since intensity of the light is not so strong like during daytime for ex.

![Lowered values for exposure and darks. WB shifted a bit to the blue side.](images/cinestill800t-vs-portra800-00017.jpg)


#### Scene 2

![Direct conversion.](images/cinestill800t-vs-portra800-00018.jpg)

![Lowered values for exposure and darks. WB shifted a bit to the blue side.](images/cinestill800t-vs-portra800-00019.jpg)

![The same as above but WB is set to NONE (assuming default film behaviour). But I prefer more reddish shadows in this case.](images/cinestill800t-vs-portra800-00020.jpg)


Also you can checkout [comparison between Frontier and Noritsu scans here](https://carmencitafilmlab.com/blog/frontier-vs-noritsu-round-2-5-years-later/).
As you can see, color tint is dramatically different between scans so looks like that there is no "true film color" once film hits digital conversion.

I hope you will find it helpful.

Thanks!
